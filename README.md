Here are some tricky algorithmic challenges I have been into. Sometimes it is needed to restore the fun of coding. This puzzles helped me take a break from my pet projects.
My purpose was not to create the best solution, but to solve the puzzle completely on my own.

I've set simple rules:
1. No google;
2. No hints;
3. No rewriting after I see other solutions (codewars, leetcode etc.). Only minor refactoring.
